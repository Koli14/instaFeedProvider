# instaFeedProvider
A simple express backend to get your cached insta feed as JSON, and an endpoint to refresh your long-lived access token.

Simply run `heroku create` 
and then `git push heroku`, to make it live.

You need to edit the environment variables in an `.env` file (see sample), or if you deploy to `heroku`, set them like descibed [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars#using-the-heroku-dashboard).

You find the other details in comments.

Any feedback or contribution is appreciated.
